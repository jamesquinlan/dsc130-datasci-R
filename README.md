# Introduction to Data Science with R


## Course description

This course is an introduction to data science using the R programming language with a focus on data acquisition and wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, inference, modeling, and effective communication of results. Students will create visualizations and models, and use them to gain insights and make predictions. In this model-based course, students are introduced to statistical analysis and models through examples. Students will perform meaningful analysis on real data. This course assumes no prior experience with programming and requires no specific statistical or mathematical knowledge beyond high school algebra.
